# Data-Structures

A repository of data structures for Python. 

## Sequential Terms

### Abstract Data Type (ADT)

An [**abstract data type (ADT)**][2] is a *set of operations* which access a collection of stored data.

### Data Structure

A [**data structure**][4] is a concrete implementation of an abstract data type.

## Big-O Notation

For each specific ADT implementation I will provide a description of the time complexity for each operation of the ADT within the docstring of the operation.

## Code Style

All code will be written in close regard to the [Google Python Style Guide][5] with the exception of the 2 space rule for any indented line.

I have changed this "two space rule" in the [pylintrc](.pylintrc) on line 295 - `indent-string='    '`

Big thanks to all!
