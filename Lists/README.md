# Description

These Python implementations of the ADT *(abstract data type)* **List**, are written to the standards shown on the wikipedia page below.

Along with these standards, each list ADT implementation will have operations defined specifically for the type of implementation.

## Each Implementation of List

1. A constructor for creating an empty list
2. An operation for testing whether or not a list is empty
3. An operation for prepending an entity to a list
4. An operation for appending an entity to a list
5. An operation for determining the first component (or the "head") of a list
6. An operation for referring to the list consisting of all the components of a list except for its first (this is called the "tail" of the list.)
7. An operation for accessing the element at a given index

## Implementations

Below are the extra operations defined on each specific implementation of the List ADT.
