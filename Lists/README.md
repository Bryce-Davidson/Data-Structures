# Description

These Java and Python implementations of the ADT *(abstract data type)* **List**, are written to the standards shown on the wikipedia page below.

Along with these standards, each list ADT implementation will have extra operations defined specifically for the type of implementation.

## Each Implementation of List ADT

- [x] a constructor for creating an empty list
- [x] an operation for testing whether or not a list is empty
- [x] an operation for prepending an entity to a list
- [x] an operation for appending an entity to a list
- [x] an operation for determining the first component (or the "head") of a list
- [x] an operation for referring to the list consisting of all the components of a list except for its first (this is called the "tail" of the list.)
- [x] an operation for accessing the element at a given index

## Implementations

Below are the extra operations defined on each specific implementation of the List ADT.

### Linked List

- [x] Find by value
- [x] Remove at beggining
- [x] Remove at end
- [x] Remove at index
- [x] Remove by value
