# Description

These Python implementations of the ADT *(abstract data type)* **List**, are written to the standards shown on the wikipedia page below.

Along with these standards, each list ADT implementation will have operations defined specifically for the type of implementation.

## Each Implementation of List

1. a constructor for creating an empty list 
2. an operation for testing whether or not a list is empty
3. an operation for prepending an entity to a list
4. an operation for appending an entity to a list
5. an operation for determining the first component (or the "head") of a list
6. an operation for referring to the list consisting of all the components of a list except for its first (this is called the "tail" of the list.)
7. an operation for accessing the element at a given index

## Implementations

Below are the extra operations defined on each specific implementation of the List ADT.
